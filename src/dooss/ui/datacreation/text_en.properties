GENOME_STRUCTURE_DESCRIPTION= \
<html> \n<font face="sans serif" size="3">\n<b>Secondary structure</b>\n<br>Specify the secondary structure characteristics of a genome or sequence.\n<ul>\n<li><b>Structure</b> - a file specifying paired sites within a sequence.</li>\n<li><b>Reference alignment</b> - a nucleotide alignment file (most formats supported), where the nucleotide positions correspond exactly to positions in the structure. This reference alignment will be used as a guide to map all subsequent data specified in this wizard.</li>\n<li><b>Nucleic acid</b> - RNA (ribonucleic acid) or DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).</li>\n<li><b>Conformation</b> - specify whether the sequence is linear or circular.</li>\n</ul>\n</font>\n </html>
SUBSTRUCTURE_DESCRIPTION=<html> \n<font face="sans serif" size="3">\n<b>Substructures</b>\n<br>Specify substructures to be displayed. Substructures are simply sub-regions of the larger consensus structure that are conceptually easier for human investigators to deal with.\n<ul>\n<li><b>Auto-generate</b> - automatically generate a list of substructures from the consensus structure with the specified size constraints. Generally you don't want the generated structures to be too large (>200 nucleotides), because they will not display nicely in the "Substructure view".</li>\n<li><b>From file</b> - use an existing list of substructures (NASP only).</li>\n</ul>\n</font>\n </html>
GENOME_ANNOTATIONS_DESCRIPTION=<html> \n<font face="sans serif" size="3">\n<b>Sequence annotations</b>\n<br>Sequence annotations provide a way of visualising the genome organization of a particular organism or annotations specific to a certain sequence. Specifying sequence annotations (e.g. genes, binding motifs, etc.) will display them in an interactive legend situated at the top of the application. This legend can be used to navigate structures at different positions within a sequence.\n<ul>\n<li><b>Add new</b> - creates a new empty annotation in the table above.</li>\n<li><b>Add from Genbank file and map (recommended)</b> - adds all the annotations contained within a particular Genbank file and maps the annotations agains the reference alignment using the first sequence contained within the Genbank file as the mapping alignment.</li>\n<li><b>Add from Genbank file without mapping</b> - adds all the annotations contained within a particular Genbank file without mapping them (not recommended).</li>\n</ul>\n</font>\n </html>
WELCOME_DESCRIPTION=<html>\n<font face="sans serif" size="4">\nThis wizard will guide you through the process of creating a dataset that can be viewed in StructureVis.\n<br>For a tutorial on how to use the dataset creation wizard select <b>Help contents</b> from the <b>Help</b> menu.\n<br><br>\n</font>\n<font face="sans serif" size="3">\n<b>Project creation</b>\n<br>Setup your project name and location:\n<ul>\n<li><b>Project name</b> - a unique name for you project. A folder with this name will be created in the project location directory.</li>\n<li><b>Project location</b> - the path where your project folder will be located. For you convenience it is recommended that you leave this path unchanged, as StructureVis will automatically go to this location when opening a project.\n<li><b>Project location</b> - the full path of your project.</li>\n</ul>\n</font>\n</html>
DATA_PANEL_DESCRIPTION=<html> \n<font face="sans serif" size="3">\n<b>Data overlays</b>\n<br>Data overlays are pieces of data that can be overlayed on the secondary structure. There are three different types of data overlay:\n<ul>\n<li><b>1-dimensional data</b> - numeric data corresponding to invididual nucleotides. The data are represented by colouring each nucleotide with a specific colour as determined by its numeric value.</li>\n<li><b>2-dimensional data</b> -  numeric data corresponding to pairs of nucleotides. The data are represented by linking each specified nucleotide pair with a line and colouring the line according to its corresponding numeric value.</li>\n<li><b>Nucleotide data</b> - data contained within a nucleotide sequence alignment. Each column of the alignment corresponds to a nucleotide within the sequence. The nucleotide conservation within a column of the alignment is represented by drawing a sequence logo in the corresponding nucleotide.</li>\n</ul>\n</font>\n </html>
